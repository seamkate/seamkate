##  About me
I have a master's degree in political science, and successful experience as a marketer, so I'm used to solving complex tasks and quickly understand what is required of me.

I know how visitors view websites and what needs to be done to increase conversions. I look at the site from two different points of perception at once, as a developer and as a user.

Now I have decided to change my profession and move into IT.

## Skills 
I make up websites adaptively and cross-browser using:
* semantic elements,
* BEM,
* Sass,
* Flex and Grid,
* Perfect Pixel.

I understand the principles of **Mobile First** and **Desktop First** and the difference between them, I prefer to use first of it in my projects.

I check and optimize the loading of sites using **Lighthouse**. I use **soft retinization** of images. I know **Gulp** and actively use Git.

## Code examples

DESCRIPTION:
Convert number to reversed array of digits
Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.

Example(Input => Output):
```
35231 => [1,3,2,5,3]
0 => [0]
```

DETAILED SOLUTION:
```
function digitize(n) {
  let newN = n.toString().split("").reverse()
  
  for (let i = 0; i < newN.length; i++ ) {
    newN[i] = +newN[i];
  }
  return newN
}
```

SHORT SOLUTION:
```
function digitize(n) {
 return String(n).split('').map(Number).reverse()
}
```
